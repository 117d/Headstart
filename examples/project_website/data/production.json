The entire crew consisted of 1 make up artist, 1 actress, 1 camera assistant for a single day and myself as all other roles in pre-production, production and post production. The initial challenge was to create a suitable narrative to work for the minimal crew while maintaining a certain quality level in production. The second challenge was managing the equipment and techniques used to shoot the film. Then the challenge of managing a full post production process as an individual. The final challenge was dealing with the lack of additional opinions through much of this process. Film is usually a collaboration where input from various skills enhances the final product.

With far fewer characters than Shakespeare's other tragedies, and no subplots, the play has an unparalleled simplicity which this production captures. Ian McKellen gives a \\\"mesmerizing performance\\\" (said the Daily Telegraph), and his Iago has more than ever before become the central character of the play. Othello is played by Willard White, the Jamaican operatic bass, in a vivid and rich performance. Imogen Stubbs breaks out of the mold cast by Peggy Ashcroft, to deliver a new Desdemona.

[Note - also available on YouTube at: http:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=gDwMEqhuab0] [The University of British Columbia opened on 22 September 1915 in facilities previously occupied by McGill University College of British Columbia in the Fairview area of Vancouver, on the site of what is now Vancouver General Hospital. Although a site commission had, several years earlier, selected Point Grey as the location for the new university, the outbreak of World War I in 1914 halted development of the site following the initial clearing of the land and some preliminary construction. Overcrowded lecture halls and inadequate laboratory facilities characterized the University's early years at Fairview. Additional space had to be found as the number of students grew. Professors held agricultural classes in a private residence, French classes in the basement of a church unused by its congregation during the week, and chemistry classes in the famous chemistry tent erected on the site. Students and faculty alike viewed the \\\"shacks\\\" at Fairview as a temporary inconvenience and looked forward to what they felt would be an imminent move to the new campus. Unfortunately, the inadequate Fairview facilities would serve as home to the University for its first full decade of existence. As the number of students attending UBC expanded, the frustration with government inaction on the construction of a new university campus also grew so much so that the students decided to take action. Planning for the student campaign began in earnest in the spring of 1922 under the leadership of returned war veteran and AMS president-elect Ab Richards.As a first step in what would become a massive and well-organized \\\"Build the University Campaign\\\", students were asked to take petitions back to their hometowns in the summer and each collect at least 25 signatures petitioning the government to resume construction of the Point Grey campus. Having collected some 17,000 signatures during the summer break, students upon their return to Vancouver in the fall embarked on a promotional campaign and massive canvas of the city to collect additional names. At the conclusion of the organized petition blitz, the students had collected approximately 56,000 signatures. The students utilized \\\"Varsity Week\\\" (October 22nd-28th) to raise public awareness about the plight of the young institution. Varsity Week activities culminated in the \\\"Pilgrimage\\\" (the term \\\"Great Trek\\\" would be coined some 25 years later) on Saturday, October 28, 1922. Nearly 1,200 students with banners and placards, floats, and a marching band made their way through downtown Vancouver and boarded electric streetcar at Granville and Davie which transported them to 10th Ave. and Sasamat in Point Grey. From there they marched on what was little more than a wagon road, to the UBC campus site and gathered beside the eight-year-old concrete and steel framework of the Science building and then climbed into the unfinished structure. That early student \\\"sit-in\\\" and subsequent Trek participants' formation of the human \\\"UBC\\\" helped lay symbolic claim to the unfinished Point Grey campus. The pilgrimage ended with the dedication of the cairn that still stands on campus (lower right). Commissioned by the students before the \\\"Great Trek\\\" it was fittingly the first structure to be completed on the new campus. Ab Richards expressed the hope that \\\"very soon around our cairn of rocks buildings will rise and a university will bring honour and glory to our Alma Mater and renown to our Province and Dominion.\\\" In the week following the pilgrimage, the students presented a 56,000-name petition to members of the B.C. Legislature in Victoria. The impressive petition, persuasive presentation and obvious public support convinced the government to resume work on the Point Grey campus, and on September 22, 1925 students crowded into a crowded auditorium for the first inaugural general assembly on the new campus. Student organization of the Great Trek and the entire publicity campaign represents a remarkable, but not isolated, chapter in UBC's history. Subsequent student initiatives led to the construction of several campus buildings including the Gymnasium (1929), Brock Hall (1940), Armoury (1941), War Memorial Gymnasium (1951) and the Student Union Building (1968). Although perhaps not on the scale of the Great Trek, these initiatives too, helped define the University.] ; Library, UBC ; Unreviewed ; Faculty\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2008\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"great trek; the great\",\"authors\":\"Hives, Christopher\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2429\\/31778\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"21d2b7ec3eb6da58b79d726d737e41ddba548be039694e3379098ef9ea5b2bd2\",\"relevance\":98,\"resulttype\":[\"Audio\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"- Skoplal trapicha, Foreign language & culture, Great Trek\",\"x\":\"-0.276850208483102\",\"y\":\"0.244383941810914\",\"labels\":\"21d2b7ec3eb6da58b79d726d737e41ddba548be039694e3379098ef9ea5b2bd2\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"- Skoplal trapicha, Foreign language & culture, Great Trek\"},{\"id\":\"27802f25af94eb8417448cb10edd172e5e1da11a412b4f456239c00ccc267a5f\",\"relation\":\"Cambridge Core Science Series: GeoBasics; 978-1-4213-5069-1; 34725; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2374.OX\\/61515\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2374.OX\\/61515\",\"title\":\"Geocycles\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Planet Earth is an amazing machine, and we\\u2014and our future\\u2014are riding on it.

Traditional project management triple constraints of cost, schedule, and performance have long been the cornerstone of Department of Defense (DoD) software project management. Often, these constraints are managed independently, using past performance data to assess and predict future project performance, leading to highly variable outcomes. Traditional waterfall models for software project delivery exacerbate this variability and limit the ability to delivery capability at the speed of relevance. By treating projects as a production system, a deeper understanding of planning variables (product design, process design) and execution variables (capacity planning, limiting work in process, and variability) can be achieved and close the gap on project delivery performance. Further, the study connects industry best practices across software, manufacturing, and construction to improve DoD software project delivery. Operations science and production management principles and techniques are foundational to the agile and lean movement. The software industry has already adopted many of the operations science and production management techniques (such as limiting work in process, capacity-based sprint planning, software factories, etc.). A succinct process to apply, monitor, control, and report out on the five levers can encourage adoption and clarify execution of the Adaptive Acquisition Framework, DoD Instruction 5000.02, Software Acquisition Pathway. ; Prepared for the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA 93943. ; Naval Postgraduate School ; Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. ; Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021-05-21\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"processes video; integration production; management into\",\"authors\":\"Kenney, Caitlin\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10945\\/68212\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"4ca29225e62e6f3e21de57c9c0129c79b561d21d7b21c798a5204dcbd4338beb\",\"relevance\":32,\"resulttype\":[\"Conference object\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Treatment, Alternative liquid fuels, Baale making\",\"x\":\"0.098502040103162\",\"y\":\"-0.0204826783492992\",\"labels\":\"4ca29225e62e6f3e21de57c9c0129c79b561d21d7b21c798a5204dcbd4338beb\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Treatment, Alternative liquid fuels, Baale making\"},{\"id\":\"4f1f5a463afc638022da8d60b3b352ed5398c8a4aeaf50cfcd7a57440cd793a7\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10625\\/50753\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10625\\/50753\",\"title\":\"Transitions : land, food and culture in transition in rural Lebanon\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The video traces local food production in Lebanese villages.

QBs are usually less than 1\\/4 in. (6 mm) in size. This report provides findings of an industry survey conducted among Illinois aggregate producers on the annual production rate, excess QBs generated, and current application areas of QBs. In addition, a detailed laboratory study was conducted to characterize the engineering properties of QB materials produced in the primary, secondary, and tertiary aggregate production stages from four different quarries operating in the State of Illinois. Since unconfined compressive strength for QB materials was low (less than 11 psi), chemical admixture stabilizers such as Portland cement and Class C fly ash were used to improve the strength properties of QB materials. Significant increases in the strength of stabilized QB materials observed may indicate suitability of QBs for sustainable pavement applications. Recommendations are made on potential strategies to utilize excess fines by incorporating QB materials in pavement construction.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2015-06\",\"subject_orig\":\"aggregate; crushed stone; quarry by-product; pavement; stabilization; sustainable\",\"subject\":\"aggregate; crushed stone; quarry by-product; pavement; stabilization; sustainable\",\"authors\":\"Tutumluer, Erol; Ozer, Hasan; Hou, Wenting; Mwumvaneza, Vincent\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2142\\/78188\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"544bc141c97e10a00b219315804571aa68ed0e03034a6f06208627bf06a5da9d\",\"relevance\":35,\"resulttype\":[\"Text\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Treatment, Alternative liquid fuels, Baale making\",\"x\":\"0.432027760225155\",\"y\":\"0.0590664321007969\",\"labels\":\"544bc141c97e10a00b219315804571aa68ed0e03034a6f06208627bf06a5da9d\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Treatment, Alternative liquid fuels, Baale making\"},{\"id\":\"54c268c2608c0a4d3044bb63bfe6874dd465d868c249d14fa118b6657cdf8cf1\",\"relation\":\"BBC TV production training course; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1903.1\\/934\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1903.1\\/934\",\"title\":\"Paul Watson documentary film maker ; Documentary film maker, Paul Watson ; Documentary film maker\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Paul Watson describes his role as director and author of the films he directs, stressing his dependence on other members of his team and relating the psychological and intellectual as much as the technical skills involved in making documentaries. ; Cameraman, Patti Musicaro ; editor, Karoline Elbogen.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"1992\",\"subject_orig\":\"Television Production and direction; Documentary films Production and direction; Watson; Paul\",\"subject\":\"Television Production and direction; Documentary films Production and direction; Watson; Paul\",\"authors\":\"\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1903.1\\/934\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"54c268c2608c0a4d3044bb63bfe6874dd465d868c249d14fa118b6657cdf8cf1\",\"relevance\":57,\"resulttype\":[\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Documentary film maker, Television production and direction, Paul Watson documentary\",\"x\":\"0.261443804833338\",\"y\":\"0.321184214451944\",\"labels\":\"54c268c2608c0a4d3044bb63bfe6874dd465d868c249d14fa118b6657cdf8cf1\",\"area_uri\":10,\"area\":\"Documentary film maker, Television production and direction, Paul Watson documentary\"},{\"id\":\"592f6577ac5e9e7b048bf2f42a7b8e91195a1a6e62d88280827eaa9c6ef4e2ab\",\"relation\":\"2013 Algae Biotreatment Symposium; https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/playlist?list=PLBCBPVHKoeNcLOTOziWjO8JmWgTKUZKWL; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/o1mEraJ-xW4; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/1HAYUlNDvmQ; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/N0dyLMqsz-A; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/XP59L9K5oSE; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/nNutIvqP2to; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2142\\/106972\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2142\\/106972; https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/playlist?list=PLBCBPVHKoeNcLOTOziWjO8JmWgTKUZKWL; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/o1mEraJ-xW4; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/1HAYUlNDvmQ; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/N0dyLMqsz-A; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/XP59L9K5oSE; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/nNutIvqP2to\",\"title\":\"Algae Biotreatment Symposium\",\"paper_abstract\":\"ISTC held a mini-symposium in October 2013 on the role of algae in future commercial applications for food, feed, bio-based materials, and bioenergy.

This immediately caught the children's attention while considerably reducing their exposure to the influence that the camera and microphone in front of them could have had. ; The project to Document aspects of Bati language and oral traditions is an original idea of Dr Emmanuel-Moselly Makasso, who had initially surveyed the Bati speech area as part of a pilot research project granted by the Ministry of Scientific Research and Technological Innovation of the Republic of Cameroon. Based on the results of this pilot research which have revealed a situation of critical endangerment of Bati language and ancestral practices, the idea to submit a major documentation project to ELDP has matured. The project has eventually been submitted during the 2015 funding round with Dr Emmanuel Ngu\\u00e9 Um as Principal Investigator, and Dr Emmanuel-Moselly Makasso as co-applicant. The project started in October 1st, 2015, and will run till the 30th of September in 2018. ; Emmanuel Ngu\\u00e9 Um is the Principal Investigator for the Bati project. He is mainly employed at the University of Yaound\\u00e9 one where he holds the position of Senior Lectuer of Linguistics, in the Departement of Cameroonian Languages and Cultures at the Higher Teacher Training School. Ngu\\u00e9 Um is also Associate Researcher at CERDOTOLA, where he is charged with the responsibility of Archive Manager for ALORA (Archive of Languages and Oral Resources of Africa).\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018-08-14\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"bati language; a documentation; language part\",\"authors\":\"\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/lat1.lis.soas.ac.uk\\/ds\\/asv?openpath=MPI1317379%23\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"5e6588864a0afb4e5396357a28f5a13e69c377a35860770005732b8c697eedb9\",\"relevance\":106,\"resulttype\":[\"Audio\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Discourse, Laryngeal video, (george homer)\",\"x\":\"-0.26325084587832\",\"y\":\"-0.195227405219439\",\"labels\":\"5e6588864a0afb4e5396357a28f5a13e69c377a35860770005732b8c697eedb9\",\"area_uri\":3,\"area\":\"Discourse, Laryngeal video, (george homer)\"},{\"id\":\"5fed5d9ceed845c3e9031b2afdb9c5340f2ca60614f9f82c43f1a4f01dc6dd71\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10125\\/55974; Bin Ibeng, Raimon, Strong, Katherine Anne, Strong, Katherine Anne, Strong, Katherine Anne, Smith, Alexander D., Kaboy, Elizabeth Unee; 2017-05-30; Raimon Bin Ibeng provides words of the natural environment, including landmarks in nature, natural phenomenon, food, fruits, and rice\\/rice production and preparation vocabulary.

The typical convent climate of modesty, isolation and self-abnegation had a fundamental impact on the production, preservation and accessibility of archives and historical data. Biographical information about individual members of orders and congregations in particular was difficult to acquire and to collect, seriously hindering sociologists and historians in developing scientifically based statistical, prosopographic or in-depth analyses of convent life. Consequently, the important phenomenon of the religious revival that manifested itself after the French Revolution in Belgium \\u2013 as elsewhere in Western Europe \\u2013 was rarely examined from a general, quantifying perspective. With approximately 50,000 female and over 10,000 male religious by the middle of the twentieth century, members of orders and congregations in Belgium represented a large social group and, considering their important impact on different societal domains (pastoral work, education, care, social provisions, \\u2026), an interesting topic for research. Moreover, the post-revolutionary convent world offers fascinating gender patterns to examine. Not only did religious women vastly outnumber religious men; analyzing male and female convent worlds may also unveil differences in social, professional and clerical position. As part of its mission to preserve convent heritage and to foster research on the world of religious institutes, KADOC-KULeuven has focused intensively on collecting archives and data on male and female religious, on a collective as well as on an individual level. In the last two decades, KADOC gradually built and implemented online instruments that allow researchers to (re-)use the many different contextual (meta)data-sets that the Center has gathered over the last decades. Some of them were newly created during research and heritage projects. Others are based on older (analogue) repertories, archives and corpora that were digitized, structured according to international standards, updated and brought online. KADOC\\u2019s main data-sets on religious institutes are stored and managed in the web-database ODIS (www.odis.be), created in 2000-2003. ODIS applies repeatable field groups and directional input, systematized by means of validated vocabularies and thesauri. Its relational field groups allow for the creation clear and univocal links between records. As a result, rich and consistent data-packages are created that create new possibilities for research. With regard to religious institutes, ODIS contains records with general information and sources about nearly 250 religious institutes, linked to records about their archives, their related organizations and institutes and their members. Records of individual female and male religious contain systematized information about their social and geographical descent, their age of entry and profession, their career within the convent, their apostolic commitments etc. This contribution focusses on the potential and limitations of the ODIS-data sets concerning religious institutes and their members, with special interest for issues of gender. The first research question is on the gender mechanisms of the revival. To what extent can the possible entanglement between male and female convent foundations, the role of male religious in female institutes, the gendered collaboration and interactions on the diverse apostolic fields and much more be examined through an analyses of the ODIS datasets? Second, we examine the potential for discerning parallels and differences between and among groups of female and male religious, for example with regard to their descent, entry, religious career and life expectancy. Third, we focus on the possibilities to quantify and qualify the international significance of Belgian male and female religious with regard to missionary activities.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"article; Film; ddc:940; Digital humanities -- Gender -- Gender history -- Geschlechtergeschichte -- Geschlecht -- Geschichte -- Tagung -- Conference -- Religion -- Mission --\",\"subject\":\"article; Film; Digital humanities; Gender; Gender history; Geschlechtergeschichte; Geschlecht; Geschichte; Tagung; Conference; Religion; Mission --\",\"authors\":\"Suenens, Kristien\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22032\\/dbt.49175\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"79045239d262788e65e77318ccf8fc68aea288a2e31c14b832a20e8335226cb5\",\"relevance\":97,\"resulttype\":[\"Audio\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22032\\/dbt.49175\",\"cluster_labels\":\"- Skoplal trapicha, Foreign language & culture, Great Trek\",\"x\":\"-0.198325821931479\",\"y\":\"-0.384373997538428\",\"labels\":\"79045239d262788e65e77318ccf8fc68aea288a2e31c14b832a20e8335226cb5\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"- Skoplal trapicha, Foreign language & culture, Great Trek\"},{\"id\":\"817984a49e43f9bd72f3a4816f928d7c51378c3ab5ddd80b53d713a8dd560ffb\",\"relation\":\"Wong, Stephen, interview by Wen, Chelsey and Kong, Sarah.

As field measurements of this process are both expensive and time consuming, indirect approaches, which can estimate primary production from remotely sensed imagery are the only viable solution. We developed a depth-resolved model of marine phytoplankton primary production using an Artificial Neural Network, namely a three-layer perceptron trained with the Error Back-Propagation algorithm. Despite numerous variables could be useful to estimate primary production, we chose to use predictive variables that can be acquired by remote sensing in order to enhance the practical value of the model. Indeed, using exclusively this type of predictors in combination with a depth-resolved approach allows to expand the two-dimensional view from satellite images to the estimated three-dimensional distribution of phytoplankton primary production. Since the vertically integrated values of this process are the basis for any connection to other levels of the pelagic food web, it is worth noting that, once integrated, the primary production estimates of this depth-resolved model are more accurate than those obtained from a similar vertically integrated approach. We also tried to improve the accuracy of the primary production estimates using constraints during the training procedure. Those constraints were based on theoretical knowledge of the marine photosynthesis process. Accordingly, the training phase has been modified in order to add penalty terms to the solutions which were not compliant with the constraints. For instance, one of the constraints acts as a selection tool for the shape of the modelled production profile. The above-mentioned approach not only enhanced the ecological soundness of the artificial neural network predictions. In fact, the constrained version of the model also explained a larger share of variance than the original one.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"Phytoplankton primary production; Artificial Neural Networks; Depth-resolved model; constrained training; remote sensing\",\"subject\":\"Phytoplankton primary production; Artificial Neural Networks; Depth-resolved model; constrained training; remote sensing\",\"authors\":\"Mattei, Francesco; Scardi, Michele\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22032\\/DBT.37974\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"81b32bfd63ed0ab2a0c66c3125d28cfd29ce67d1a10f92d01a6de4c367562c1f\",\"relevance\":33,\"resulttype\":[\"Text\",\"Audio\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22032\\/DBT.37974\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Treatment, Alternative liquid fuels, Baale making\",\"x\":\"0.200927160697188\",\"y\":\"0.0556733905087192\",\"labels\":\"81b32bfd63ed0ab2a0c66c3125d28cfd29ce67d1a10f92d01a6de4c367562c1f\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Treatment, Alternative liquid fuels, Baale making\"},{\"id\":\"8d4a07459b5ab4d8847c8edb61ad4f8a2c295e56ebd760a1464f413f47ae79a1\",\"relation\":\"Felipe II; 978-0-7365-7641-3; 32323; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2374.OX\\/60860\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2374.OX\\/60860\",\"title\":\"La Sombra del Emperador\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Through military action or political alliance, the hand of Philip II's father, Charles V, lay heavily upon portions of the Old World, the New World, and the Far East\\u2014but the scope of his imperialistic scheme was thwarted by the inexorable political realities of the day.

It analyses the democratization of local government through the creation of new electoral circumscriptions, which aim to facilitate public participation: the wards. The study focuses on ward 44, which brings together territories formerly divided by apartheid. The immersion in the daily lives of various families highlights the mechanisms of a community-based governmentality, where individual political legitimacy is intertwined with the shared experience of the city.The PhD comes with a DVD comprising sixteen video excerpts of life narratives, scenes of daily life and neighbourhood events. The pragmatic tactics that urban residents deploy on a daily basis thus reveal their full complexity. They not only adjust to on-going institutional reforms, they also condition the very implementation of these reforms. Eventually, the resistance to spatial inequalities is carried out through the figure of the \\u201ccitadins-citoyens\\u201d, the \\u201curban citizen\\u201d who on a daily basis invents what could be the right to the city in South Africa.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2011-11-25\",\"subject_orig\":\"Le Cap; Citoyennet\\u00e9; Citadins; Droit \\u00e0 la ville; Henri Lefebvre; Communaut\\u00e9; Vid\\u00e9o; Cape Town; Citizenship; Urban dwellers; Right to the city; Community; Video\",\"subject\":\"Le Cap; Citoyennet\\u00e9; Citadins; Droit \\u00e0 la ville; Henri Lefebvre; Communaut\\u00e9; Vid\\u00e9o; Cape Town; Citizenship; Urban dwellers; Right to the city; Community; Video\",\"authors\":\"Buire, Chlo\\u00e9\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.theses.fr\\/2011PA100161\\/document\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"bc77b62f9b244b8c21e4f9a23cf39fe6c868d35d385a07063f22697f24363b53\",\"relevance\":99,\"resulttype\":[\"Thesis\",\"Audio\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Happy birthday, Joyeux anniversaire, Chanson\",\"x\":\"-0.472483338322218\",\"y\":\"0.069470149354683\",\"labels\":\"bc77b62f9b244b8c21e4f9a23cf39fe6c868d35d385a07063f22697f24363b53\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Happy birthday, Joyeux anniversaire, Chanson\"},{\"id\":\"bc8556c1c812fb6907cae896e915b4244bd57de1ebbecae7b26bb32aa5c1723d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/lat1.lis.soas.ac.uk\\/ds\\/asv?openpath=MPI1033962%23\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/lat1.lis.soas.ac.uk\\/ds\\/asv?openpath=MPI1033962%23\",\"title\":\"The bride is taken from her home ; wedding ; Documentation of Baga Mandori (Atlantic, NIger-Congo) (ISO 639-3:bmd)\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The first speaker p026, p053 and p048 might be the same person.

This is a good estimate given that he says that he did not have any children but was already married dwhen Lansana Cont\\u00e9 took power. Although I would add 10 years, because of that. He is part of the S\\u00e8r\\u00e8 \\\"Group Kalala\\\". For mutual support or help the village, if financial need arrives. He has been a member for 3 years. He is not initiated. According to him e does not move around very much. He sometimes goes to Bok\\u00e9 or Kolaboui, because some of his children go to school there. ; He said that he is 35 years old, but then we established that it was long before Lansana Cont\\u00e9 took power that he was born. He already had 2 children at that time. He also said that he was born durng the reign of Sekou Tour\\u00e9 By estimating that he was about 22 years old at that time, we arrive at an age of 54. He studied to be a mason and builder with a local mason at Dobali. He says that he has been doing this for 8 years. He is not a member of a S\\u00e8r\\u00e8. He is not initiated. He does not move around very often and goes to Kamsar maybe once a year, he says. He says he moves around in the immediate region around Dobali. ; He is part of the S\\u00e8r\\u00e8, that is he just founded a S\\u00e8r\\u00e8 with about 25 or 30 people, that does not have a name yet. The S\\u00e8r\\u00e8 is for mutual support. He is the leader of the S\\u00e8r\\u00e8. He also part of another association that does not have a name, it is also for mutual support. Nowadays he mostly stays at Kakrunt, and moves around to go to Kamsar, Bok\\u00e9, or Conakry. He can leave about 3-4 times to visit relatives in those places. ; We established that he was about had his first child around the time when Sekou Tour\\u00e9 took power, which makes me think he is around 65. He gave his age as 70 years. He stays mainly in Bitonko, but he can go for a short time to Kamsar, if necessary. He said that a family father can only leave for two reasons: sickness or the necessitsy to manage some personal affairs. For the latter one takes about 2-3 days, in the former case that can be of longer duration. ; As a note on the nickname in \\\"Nom de terrain\\\": Women are often identified by locality or family in my interviews. When asked interviewees did not provide nicknames as readily as men. The age is also unsure. As orientation she indicated that she was already married when Sekou Tour\\u00e9 took power. Let's say she was 20 in 1958, that would give an age around 76. She used to farm the most common crops of this area: grounduts, rice, millet, fonio. She says that in case of the groundnuts, it was her who cultivated them and then her husband went to sell them at the market. She says that she gets a little bit of money for her mid-wife services (this includes female excision). She is not part of a S\\u00e8r\\u00e8 at the moment. That is for younger people, but she used to be part of a S\\u00e9r\\u00e9, called \\/makissa\\/ for a few years. She said that she is not initiated. In the interview she used an interesting phrase (in translation from p002) Baga d'ici to differentiate from the other Baga people. She is the mother of p029 and lives with her second husband. Both husbands were Baga from Bitonko (Cherif Camara (Kandoma, near Kolaboui, is where he studied), Soriba Camara.) She is currently limited to Bitonko, but when her husband lived she often went to Kandoma. ; p026 spent a substantial part of his life outside the village. He says he worked in Conkary, Nz\\u00e9r\\u00e9kor\\u00e9, Koundara. He worked for TP (Travaux publiques) at first from 55' to 60', then he worked as a French Mining Company for '61 to 63', then he was a teacher at Nz\\u00e8r\\u00e8kor\\u00e8 until '66 (2 years at Nz\\u00e9\\u00e9kor\\u00e9, and 2 years at Bintonko), then he says he worked in a storage facility (Magazin g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale) for the state at Koundara (Commerce d'\\u00e9tat) for 6 years. After that he came back to stay in Bok\\u00e9 around 1975 (he says he did not work, and relied on his children ever since then), he only came back to live in the village 2 years ago. He says that his children work the fields for him (groundnuts, rice). He says it is for subsistence. He says that he once travelled to Senegal with goods that he had bought in Koundara to sell there. He never fished. He never was involved in Palm Oil production. He is not part of a S\\u00e8r\\u00e8. He says he has not been initiated here. ; He said that he is 80 years old. However, we established that he was born around the time when Sekou Tour\\u00e9 took power, which puts his age at around 55. In the interview he made an interesting comment claiming that his father only knew Baga, which is then countered by his claim that his father had married a Susu wife. His mother was from Boffa. He stays mostly in Bitonko during the year. He sometimes goes to Boke, Kamsar, Conakry, Fria to visit relatives. He moves around alot in the region (Kamsar and Boke, is where he sells his goods (groundnuts). Each month he leaves Bitonko maybe 2-3 times to move around in the region. He also goes to Bissau to visit relatives (he visits the capital and\\/or villages\\/cities close to the border). He says that there are no Baga villages in Bissau, but some familymembers went to reside with the Nalu and Balanta. ; This is the woman carrying the calabash to at the beginning of the video 20140329_wedding.mpg. There was no time to collect data on her. This will have to be done later. ; His name is Karim Camara and he appears in two clips related to the wedding ceremony recorded. I could not get his data or explicit consent recorded, because he lived in a village further away. It is interesting that he could not speak Baga Mandori, yet he is related to the family, as I was told.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2014-03-28\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"documentation baga; the bride; atlantic niger\",\"authors\":\"\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/lat1.lis.soas.ac.uk\\/ds\\/asv?openpath=MPI1033962%23\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"bc8556c1c812fb6907cae896e915b4244bd57de1ebbecae7b26bb32aa5c1723d\",\"relevance\":96,\"resulttype\":[\"Audio\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Discourse, Laryngeal video, (george homer)\",\"x\":\"-0.306082492527326\",\"y\":\"-0.215379059139379\",\"labels\":\"bc8556c1c812fb6907cae896e915b4244bd57de1ebbecae7b26bb32aa5c1723d\",\"area_uri\":3,\"area\":\"Discourse, Laryngeal video, (george homer)\"},{\"id\":\"bc90360e0abf2b605314c2232029b664cbcee97edaf12b215f743f19f6c22c66\",\"relation\":\"CCAFS. 2011.

This question is addressed through a statistically-driven corpus analysis of hip-hop music released during the genre's Golden Age era. The first part of the paper presents a methodology for developing, transcribing, and analyzing a corpus of 100 hip-hop tracks released during the Golden Age. Eight categories of aurally salient musical and production parameters are analyzed: tempo, orchestration and texture, harmony, form, vocal and lyric profiles, global and local production effects, vocal doubling and backing, and loudness and compression. The second part of the paper organizes the analysis data into three trend categories: trends of change (parameters that change over time), trends of prevalence (parameters that remain generally constant across the corpus), and trends of similarity (parameters that are similar from song to song). These trends form a generalized model of the Golden Age hip-hop sound which considers both global (the whole corpus) and local (unique songs within the corpus) contexts. By operationalizing \\\"sound\\\" as the sum of musical and production parameters, aspects of popular music that are resistant to traditional music-analytical methods can be considered.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"corpus study; sound; Golden Age hip-hop; music production; empirical musicology\",\"subject\":\"corpus study; sound; Golden Age hip-hop; music production; empirical musicology\",\"authors\":\"Duinker, Ben; Martin, Denis\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1811\\/81126\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"d93bc1f681147ca2a3e9d3cc0cc650e507a289880bce3ea26d0354665d4eaacb\",\"relevance\":94,\"resulttype\":[\"Audio\",\"Still image\",\"Dataset\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Happy birthday, Joyeux anniversaire, Chanson\",\"x\":\"-0.0667238935564578\",\"y\":\"0.308406262367928\",\"labels\":\"d93bc1f681147ca2a3e9d3cc0cc650e507a289880bce3ea26d0354665d4eaacb\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Happy birthday, Joyeux anniversaire, Chanson\"},{\"id\":\"da84905b751df3673d6c368afba838db558a2e1dc4d1ca04b4d124c5eb0a914b\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11041\\/sldr000782; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11041\\/sldr000782?urlappend=\\/preview\\/picto.png; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11041\\/sldr000782?urlappend=\\/toc; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11041\\/sldr000782\\/Documentation_DySpoLec.pdf; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11041\\/sldr000782\\/Ext-DySpoLec-co-lec-s5.mp3; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11041\\/sldr000782\\/Ext-DySpoLec-co-spo-s4.mp3; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11041\\/sldr000782\\/Ext-DySpoLec-dy-lec-s4.mp3; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11041\\/sldr000782\\/Ext-DySpoLec-dy-spo-s8.mp3; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11041\\/sldr000782\\/picto.png\",\"title\":\"DySpoLec\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The DySpoLec corpus is an audio corpus featuring recordings of 19 normal readers and dyslexic children (10-11-year-old).

At the production level, it is necessary to simultaneously consider medium-term (planning) and short-term (scheduling) decisions. Despite recent advances in computer hardware and optimization software, current methods are insufficient to address real-world instances of this integrated problem. Three approaches to this integrated problem are discussed. First, a novel formulation for the \\u201cgeneralized\\u201d lot-sizing problem is presented. This formulation accounts for process characteristics that are common in the chemical industry but are not addressed by existing approaches. Second, a number of theoretical results for discrete-time formulations are developed, enabling us to formulate problems that can be solved very effectively. Third, we present how detailed scheduling models can be used off-line to obtain an approximation of feasible production levels and an underestimation of production cost. Finally, we present how these methods can be used to address large-scale integrated planning-scheduling problems.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2009-04-15\",\"subject_orig\":\"Discrete-time formulations; Lot-sizing problem; Production planning in chemical industry; Scheduling in chemical industry\",\"subject\":\"Discrete-time formulations; Lot-sizing problem; Production planning in chemical industry; Scheduling in chemical industry\",\"authors\":\"Maravelias, Christos T.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1853\\/27921\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"db251e98706cdeda7a67bd13a5d9e4182e1ff624a5f542117d9253d0353f44ce\",\"relevance\":34,\"resulttype\":[\"Lecture\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Treatment, Alternative liquid fuels, Baale making\",\"x\":\"0.335836363105364\",\"y\":\"0.0366057584314225\",\"labels\":\"db251e98706cdeda7a67bd13a5d9e4182e1ff624a5f542117d9253d0353f44ce\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Treatment, Alternative liquid fuels, Baale making\"},{\"id\":\"dc131a5becb1266183356948b85b8b4fde92ad4aad296069542288485c1222b3\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1811\\/37877\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1811\\/37877\",\"title\":\"How Red is the Pink Tide in Hugo Ch\\u00e1vez's Venezuela?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The University Archives has determined that this item is of continuing value to OSU's history. ; President Hugo Ch\\u00e1vez has made it his goal to create \\\"21st Century Socialism\\\" in Venezuela.

Pelicito explains that nowadays, they rather use snares to in order catch animals, which they have to place far away in the mountains because the wild pags are scarce. At the time, they could not go very far, because if an Alta entered the domain of the Ilongot tribe he could get killed.

Therefore, the production of gold nanoparticles (and nanoparticles of other metals) through green nanotechnology routes will have tremendous implications in a number of fields. In 2008, we discovered an unprecedented approach to Green Nanotechnology via the use of phytochemicals in Soy for the production of gold nanoparticles. This process simply involved mixing of Soy seeds, in water, with gold salt that led to the production of well-defined biocompatible gold nanoparticles (Editor s Choice in SCIENCE, 2008). With this genesis of Green Nanotechnological approach, we have developed numerous processes recently that take advantage of redox properties of phytochemicals in Tea, Cumin, Cinnamon and plethora of herbs, plants, seeds and tree extracts all of which have resulted in the production of gold nanoparticles through interactions of corresponding phytochemicals with gold salt in water. Our research has further probed on the importance of such green nanotechnological processes for the production of cancer specific gold nanoparticles. For example, gold nanoparticles derived from Tea has been shown to have a coating of Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), also known as epigallocatechin 3-gallate, the ester of epigallocatechin and gallic acid, and is a type ofcatechin. EGCG is the most abundant catechin in tea and is a potent antioxidant that has well proven therapeutic applications in the treatment of many human disorders and diseases including cancer. EGCG has an excellent affinity toward Laminin receptors which are overexpressed in hormone refractory prostate cancers. MU's process for the production of biocompatible gold nanoparticles has been highlighted in Discovery Channel News and won the award of One of Ten Best Inventions in 2010.
