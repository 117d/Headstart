6,Gut Project,1,2,1,Video,"Science Slam, TV, Video Sharing","The Gut project is a one-person project founded by Giulia Enders, with the aim to explain the functionality of a very complex organ, the gut, in a basic language that is understandable for the general audience. The project also wants to initiate discussions around this topic, which are usually avoided by people. As a PhD student in Medicine, Enders was fascinated with the functioning of the gut. So she decided to investigate and study this complex organ, the importance of which is usually underestimated. After her success in several science slams in 2012, she got an offer to write a book about the gut. Her book (published in March 2014) was a huge success, because of the way she explains the complex process of digestion. She presents facts in a simple way, understandable for the broader audience, and she uses a lot of humour at the same time.",,2017,https://www.openuphub.eu/component/k2/item/605-gut-giulia-enders,asdf128,,0

It is now available on the platform Zooniverse.org that is currently the largest aggregator of crowd science projects in various disciplines. Galaxy Zoo is a project which invites people to assist in the morphological classification of large numbers of galaxies through a website. Citizens classifying galaxies help scientists to understand how galaxies evolved over time and test theories about the nature of the Universe. The purpose of dissemination is twofold: sharing research data in the format of galaxy images and involving citizens in the analysis of these scientific data.",,2017,https://www.openuphub.eu/component/k2/item/602-galaxy-zoo,asdf137,,0

34,Transcribe Bentham,1,0,1,Collaborative Research,Collaboration Platform,"Transcribe Bentham is an online collaborative initiative to transcribe the manuscripts of Jeremy Bentham from the archives of University College London. Jeremy Bentham (1748 – 1832) was an English philosopher, jurist, and social reformer. He is regarded as the founder of modern utilitarianism. The goal of the project is to collaboratively, with the help of many volunteers, digitise valuable handwritten, yet unpublished, work of Jeremy Bentham. By reading and encoding yet unread Bentham's work, new facts can be discovered about his thoughts. In this way, UCL was able to publish new editions of Bentham's work and make them publicly available through the UCL's digital library. Since 2014 Transcribe Bentham is part of the EU-funded Recognition and Enrichment of Archival Documents (READ) project.",,2017,https://www.openuphub.eu/component/k2/item/608-transcribe-bentham,asdf156,,0
