Pluto Fly-by,"Video:Live streaming, Video:Video Sharing","Different dissemination activities were conducted, such as a Twitter campaign, live streams, YouTube videos, and press, by disseminating text, video, data, software and simulations. Outputs of the dissemination activities were very rich and can be categorized into images, series of videos, live streams, simulation software, blogs, scientific data, reports and scientific articles. ","NASA's New Horizons probe has visited a place never before visited by a robotic probe from earth: Pluto. In July 2015, the spacecraft completed a nearly-decade-long journey to fly by Pluto, and revealed humanity's first close-up look at the distant dwarf planet (Dwarf planet).

Gut Project,"Performance:Science Slam, Video:Video Sharing, Video:TV, Video:Interviews","One of the first dissemination activities were a number of science slams, in which Giulia Enders gave a talk about the gut. After the science slams and especially after publishing her book “Darm mit Charme” (translated into English, French and Italian) she gained a lot of popularity. She was invited to different TV shows and her story was covered by well-known newspapers. Her book readings were also very well visited.","The Gut project is a one-person project founded by Giulia Enders, with the aim to explain the functionality of a very complex organ, the gut, in a basic language that is understandable for the general audience. The project also wants to initiate discussions around this topic, which are usually avoided by people. As a PhD student in Medicine, Enders was fascinated with the functioning of the gut. So she decided to investigate and study this complex organ, the importance of which is usually underestimated. After her success in several science slams in 2012, she got an offer to write a book about the gut. Her book (published in March 2014) was a huge success, because of the way she explains the complex process of digestion. She presents facts in a simple way, understandable for the broader audience, and she uses a lot of humour at the same time.",https://www.openuphub.eu/component/k2/item/605-gut-giulia-enders,medium,generalpublic

It includes a blog and a forum that support the volunteers in the discussion, analysis and classification of galaxies. Other dissemination activities are videos available on You Tube, releases and news articles in important journals and TV (Times Online, USA today, Spiegel online, BBC news, etc.). The main dissemination contents are images, video, text and data. The dissemination project outputs are both galaxy images associated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), available on the ad hoc developed Galaxy Zoo website, and the results presented in scientific articles and open-source sets of the analysed data.","Galaxy Zoo is a well-known online citizen science project (Sauermann and Franzoni 2014), where the general public is directly involved in research activities. It is now available on the platform Zooniverse.org that is currently the largest aggregator of crowd science projects in various disciplines. Galaxy Zoo is a project which invites people to assist in the morphological classification of large numbers of galaxies through a website. Citizens classifying galaxies help scientists to understand how galaxies evolved over time and test theories about the nature of the Universe.

ScienceAtHome,Games:Games,"ScienceAtHome project uses various methods to communicate its objectives to wider audiences and to engage citizens. Its main focal point is set on the use of social media. It has a very active presence on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn, where it disseminates project updates and news from the science community. Especially the YouTube channel is used to upload videos series about citizen science, quantum physics and game demos and animated videos explaining the concept,. In addition, an important aspect of the ScienceAtHome dissemination activities is the use of gaming elements which lead to the users’ engagement (e.g. leaderboard, scoreboard). Another useful tool that the project uses is the Blog. Weekly posts are written by a team of people that is specialised in online community engagement or the official account of ScienceAtHome. Moreover, the project has two Wikipedia references, which also increases its visibility to the general public. The first reference is under the topic of citizen science and the second one under the entry “Quantum Move”, an online citizen science simulation video game, which is part of the ScienceAtHome project. Additionally, physical project presentations like the TED talk at the TEDxAarhus 2016 and the presentation at the NIWeek 2016 contribute successfully to the outreach of ScienceAtHome to wider audiences. The project has produced a plethora of dissemination outputs such as images, video series, audio material, software (simulation games), blogs, press references, scientific data and articles. ","ScienceAtHome is an online platform for collaborative volunteer research, where people are invited to play scientific games, have fun and contribute to real discoveries on quantum physics, and human thinking. The team behind the project consists of scientists, game developers, designers and visual artists based at Aarhus University of Denmark and creates scientific games, with the aim to revolutionise scientific research and teaching by game-play.

Homer Multitext,Website:Project Website,"In terms of dissemination activities that go beyond traditional academic publishing and attending conferences, the project mainly used the website, a blog, and GitHub for disseminating their research online. Next to that the project organised summer seminars as well. The HMT community is also very active on Twitter. The project had various dissemination outputs. Next to the blog the project published a number of scientific publications, images of scanned manuscripts and transcripts, and a complete edition of the Venetus A manuscript, which is openly available as PDF. The disseminated materials include text, photos, a book (the aforementioned PDF), and the HMT software.

Transcribe Bentham,Collaborative Research:Collaboration Platform,"Dissemination activities conducted within the project are numerous and vary from public information blogs, announcements and articles in the press, invited talks, journal articles to Twitter, Facebook posts, Wikipedia article and YouTube videos. One of most important outputs of the project are the digitised/transcribed Bentham manuscripts that are made publicly available. Furthermore, the transcription tool, and the software behind it plays a special role in the digitisation process.","Transcribe Bentham is an online collaborative initiative to transcribe the manuscripts of Jeremy Bentham from the archives of University College London. Jeremy Bentham (1748 – 1832) was an English philosopher, jurist, and social reformer. He is regarded as the founder of modern utilitarianism. The goal of the project is to collaboratively, with the help of many volunteers, digitise valuable handwritten, yet unpublished, work of Jeremy Bentham. By reading and encoding yet unread Bentham's work, new facts can be discovered about his thoughts. In this way, UCL was able to publish new editions of Bentham's work and make them publicly available through the UCL's digital library.
