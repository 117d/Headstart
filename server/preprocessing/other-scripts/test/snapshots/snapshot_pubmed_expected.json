Measurement of quality of life of persons suffering from psoriasis could become an important factor in assessing the success of treatment and modern aspect of integration of the diseased into the planning of therapeutic procedures, monitoring of their outcomes and improving the quality of treatment.To determine the quality of life and the degree of depression of persons with psoriasis, as well as to make a correlation between the two.A descriptive and analytical study of cross-sectional character has been performed. The sample consisted of N = 56 respondents with medically verified diagnosis of psoriasis that was treated at the Clinic for Skin and Venereal Diseases of the Clinical Centre of the University of Sarajevo. Criteria for involvement of participants: respondents are to be over 18 years of age with verified medical diagnosis of psoriasis, and to voluntarily consent for inclusion in the research. The research instruments consisted of standardized questionnaires: the WHO-BREF Quality Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory.Median value of scores relating to quality of life of persons with psoriasis from our sample was highest in the domain of social interaction and amounted to 72 (51.50-81.00); the domain of physical health was 63 (39.50-75.00); the psychological condition was 63 (44.00-75.00); and the environmental domain was 63 (44.00-73.50).

Chronic dermatitis is a major sociomedical issue still being marginalized due to generally accepted view that skin diseases are less of a health problem than is the case with diseases of other organs and organ systems for they are not life-threatening. Measurement of quality of life of persons suffering from psoriasis could become an important factor in assessing the success of treatment and modern aspect of integration of the diseased into the planning of therapeutic procedures, monitoring of their outcomes and improving the quality of treatment.To determine the quality of life and the degree of depression of persons with psoriasis, as well as to make a correlation between the two.A descriptive and analytical study of cross-sectional character has been performed. The sample consisted of N = 56 respondents with medically verified diagnosis of psoriasis that was treated at the Clinic for Skin and Venereal Diseases of the Clinical Centre of the University of Sarajevo. Criteria for involvement of participants: respondents are to be over 18 years of age with verified medical diagnosis of psoriasis, and to voluntarily consent for inclusion in the research. The research instruments consisted of standardized questionnaires: the WHO-BREF Quality Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory.Median value of scores relating to quality of life of persons with psoriasis from our sample was highest in the domain of social interaction and amounted to 72 (51.50-81.00); the domain of physical health was 63 (39.50-75.00); the psychological condition was 63 (44.00-75.00); and the environmental domain was 63 (44.00-73.50). Depression of persons with psoriasis showed correlation with domains of quality of life. The depression proved correlated with the respondents': physical health (rho = -0.793 p = 0.0001); psychological health (rho = -0.842 p = 0.0001); social interactions (rho = -0.598 p = 0.0001); as well as with attitude towards the environment (rho = -0.709 p = 0.0001).

In this study, we calculated the proportion of children aged 12-48 months who were fully vaccinated, under-vaccinated, or who had not received any vaccines. Childhood, household, and sociocultural factors associated with under-vaccination and non-vaccination were evaluated. Methods Using data from India's 4th District-level Health and Facility Survey, 2012-2013 (DLHS-4) and the 2012-2013 Annual Health Survey (AHS), we calculated the proportion of children who were non-vaccinated, under-vaccinated, or fully vaccinated with 1 dose of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, 3 doses of oral polio vaccine, 3 doses of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, and 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine. The odds of full vaccination compared to non-vaccination and under-vaccination relative to various factors was assessed using a multivariable, multinomial logistic regression which accounted for survey design. Results Of 1,929,580 children aged 12-48 months, 59% were fully vaccinated, 34% were under-vaccinated, and 7% were non-vaccinated.

Objectives India has more unvaccinated children than any other country despite provision of free vaccines through the government's Universal Immunization Program. In this study, we calculated the proportion of children aged 12-48 months who were fully vaccinated, under-vaccinated, or who had not received any vaccines. Childhood, household, and sociocultural factors associated with under-vaccination and non-vaccination were evaluated. Methods Using data from India's 4th District-level Health and Facility Survey, 2012-2013 (DLHS-4) and the 2012-2013 Annual Health Survey (AHS), we calculated the proportion of children who were non-vaccinated, under-vaccinated, or fully vaccinated with 1 dose of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, 3 doses of oral polio vaccine, 3 doses of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, and 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine. The odds of full vaccination compared to non-vaccination and under-vaccination relative to various factors was assessed using a multivariable, multinomial logistic regression which accounted for survey design. Results Of 1,929,580 children aged 12-48 months, 59% were fully vaccinated, 34% were under-vaccinated, and 7% were non-vaccinated. Compared to children born in government institutions, children delivered in non-institutional settings with a skilled birth attendant present had higher odds of non-vaccination (OR 1.66) and those without a skilled attendant present had still greater odds of non-vaccination (OR 2.39) and under-vaccination (OR 1.11).

Adolescent peer groups have been found to be an important influence on a range of health behaviours. The characteristics of young women's friendships might influence their sexual health and HIV risk via connections to sexual partners, norms around sexual initiation and condom use, or provision of social support. We investigated associations between young women's friendships and their Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) and HIV infection status in rural South Africa.Our study is a cross-sectional, egocentric network analysis. In 2011 to 2012, we tested 13- to 20-year-old young women for HIV and HSV-2, and collected descriptions of five friendships for each. We generated summary measures describing friend socio-demographic characteristics and the number of friends perceived to have had sex. We used logistic regression to analyse associations between friend characteristics and participant HIV and HSV-2 infection, excluding likely perinatal HIV infections.There were 2326 participants included in the study sample, among whom HIV and HSV-2 prevalence were 3.3% and 4.6% respectively. Adjusted for participant and friend socio-demographic characteristics, each additional friend at least one year older than the participant was associated with raised odds of HIV (odds ratio (OR) = 1.37, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.82) and HSV-2 (adjusted OR=1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69). Each additional friend perceived to have ever had sex also raised the odds of HIV (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.63) and HSV-2 (OR=1.18, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.35).We found good evidence that a greater number of older friends and friends perceived to have had sex were associated with increased risk for HSV-2 and HIV infection among young women.The characteristics of young women's friendships could contribute to their risk of HIV infection.

Prevalence of HIV among young women in South Africa remains extremely high. Adolescent peer groups have been found to be an important influence on a range of health behaviours. The characteristics of young women's friendships might influence their sexual health and HIV risk via connections to sexual partners, norms around sexual initiation and condom use, or provision of social support. We investigated associations between young women's friendships and their Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) and HIV infection status in rural South Africa.Our study is a cross-sectional, egocentric network analysis. In 2011 to 2012, we tested 13- to 20-year-old young women for HIV and HSV-2, and collected descriptions of five friendships for each. We generated summary measures describing friend socio-demographic characteristics and the number of friends perceived to have had sex. We used logistic regression to analyse associations between friend characteristics and participant HIV and HSV-2 infection, excluding likely perinatal HIV infections.There were 2326 participants included in the study sample, among whom HIV and HSV-2 prevalence were 3.3% and 4.6% respectively. Adjusted for participant and friend socio-demographic characteristics, each additional friend at least one year older than the participant was associated with raised odds of HIV (odds ratio (OR) = 1.37, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.82) and HSV-2 (adjusted OR=1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69). Each additional friend perceived to have ever had sex also raised the odds of HIV (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.63) and HSV-2 (OR=1.18, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.35).We found good evidence that a greater number of older friends and friends perceived to have had sex were associated with increased risk for HSV-2 and HIV infection among young women.The characteristics of young women's friendships could contribute to their risk of HIV infection.

We suggest that a formaldehyde-fixed human cadaver model is an adequate, practical and cost-effective approach to ensure proper surgical training before implanting microelectrode arrays in the living human neocortex.

Data were collected during December 2016 and February 2017 using demographicsheets, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire and themodified Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed fordata analysis. Results: The mean age of the sample was 50.2 years (SD = 11.50). Study participants reported moderateto poor quality of life (M = 33.5, SD = 23.5). Multiple regression analysis showed that age, years of education, stage,past breast surgery, overall symptom severity, and social support significantly explained 56.8% of the variance inquality of life (R2 = .568, F (8,76) = 12.469, p = .000). However, overall symptom severity (β = -.477, p= .000) andsocial support (β = .183, p = .050) were the most important predictors.

Based on a fluorescence quenching method, an improved mathematical model was adopted to calculate the binding constants, with a correction for the inner-filter effect. Hydroxylation at the 3-position increased the affinity of the phenolic acids for β-lactoglobulin, while hydroxylation at the 2- or 4-positions had a negative effect.

While ASD knowledge among neurosurgeons has been evaluated, ASD knowledge among orthopedic spine surgeons has not previously been reported.A survey of orthopedic spine surgeon members of North American Spine Society (NASS) was conducted to assess level of spine surgery training, practice experience, and spinal deformity knowledge base. The survey used was previously completed by a group of neurologic surgeons with published results. The survey used 11 questions developed and agreed upon by experienced spinal deformity surgeons.Complete responses were received from 413 orthopedic spine surgeons. The overall correct-answer rate was 69.0%.

Survey study.The purpose of this paper was to assess the level of adult spine deformity (ASD) knowledge among orthopedic spine surgeons and identify areas for improvement in spine surgery training.ASD is increasingly encountered in spine surgery practice. While ASD knowledge among neurosurgeons has been evaluated, ASD knowledge among orthopedic spine surgeons has not previously been reported.A survey of orthopedic spine surgeon members of North American Spine Society (NASS) was conducted to assess level of spine surgery training, practice experience, and spinal deformity knowledge base. The survey used was previously completed by a group of neurologic surgeons with published results. The survey used 11 questions developed and agreed upon by experienced spinal deformity surgeons.Complete responses were received from 413 orthopedic spine surgeons. The overall correct-answer rate was 69.0%. Surgeons in practice for less than 10 years had a higher correct-answer rate compared to those who have practiced for 10 years or more (74% vs. 67%; p = .000003).

No guidelines were identified worldwide to assist health care providers and educational institutions in workforce development and education guidelines to minimise patients' risk of adverse events. The Interventional Nurses Council (INC) developed a definition and scope of practice for interventional cardiac nursing (ICN's) in 2013. The INC executive committee established a working party of seven representatives from Australia and New Zealand. Selection was based on expertise in interventional cardiovascular nursing and experience providing education and mentoring in the clinical and postgraduate environment. A literature search of the electronic databases Science Direct, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline and Health Source was performed, using the search terms: clinical deterioration, ST elevation myocardial infarction, vital signs, primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, AMI, STEMI, acute coronary syndrome, peri-procedural care, unstable angina, PCI complications, structural heart disease, TAVI, TAVR, cardiac rhythm management, pacing, electrophysiology studies, vascular access, procedural sedation. Articles were limited to the cardiac catheterisation laboratory and relevance to nursing based outcomes. Reference lists were examined to identify relevant articles missed in the initial search. The literature was compared with national competency standards, quality and safety documents and the INC definition and scope of practice. Consensus of common themes, a taxonomy of education and seven competency domains were achieved via frequent teleconferences and two face-to-face meetings.

Interventional cardiovascular nursing is a critical care nursing specialty providing complex nursing interventions to patients prone to clinical deterioration, through the combined risks of the pathophysiology of their illness and undergoing technically complex interventional cardiovascular procedures. No guidelines were identified worldwide to assist health care providers and educational institutions in workforce development and education guidelines to minimise patients' risk of adverse events. The Interventional Nurses Council (INC) developed a definition and scope of practice for interventional cardiac nursing (ICN's) in 2013. The INC executive committee established a working party of seven representatives from Australia and New Zealand. Selection was based on expertise in interventional cardiovascular nursing and experience providing education and mentoring in the clinical and postgraduate environment. A literature search of the electronic databases Science Direct, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline and Health Source was performed, using the search terms: clinical deterioration, ST elevation myocardial infarction, vital signs, primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, AMI, STEMI, acute coronary syndrome, peri-procedural care, unstable angina, PCI complications, structural heart disease, TAVI, TAVR, cardiac rhythm management, pacing, electrophysiology studies, vascular access, procedural sedation. Articles were limited to the cardiac catheterisation laboratory and relevance to nursing based outcomes. Reference lists were examined to identify relevant articles missed in the initial search. The literature was compared with national competency standards, quality and safety documents and the INC definition and scope of practice. Consensus of common themes, a taxonomy of education and seven competency domains were achieved via frequent teleconferences and two face-to-face meetings. The working party finalised the standards on 14 July 2017, following endorsement from the CSANZ, INC, Heart Rhythm Council, CSANZ Quality Standards Committee and the Australian College of Critical Care Nurses (ACCCN). The resulting document provides clinical practice and education standards for interventional cardiac nursing practice.Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were used to determine the cutoff scores for significant predictors of recurrent falls.The number of falls during the 42-week follow-up period.Baseline measures that significantly predicted the number of falls included increased number of medications, higher depression scores, and decreased FRT. Cutoff scores for the number of medications were 8.5 with an AUC of 0.68. Depression scores differentiated recurrent fallers at a threshold of 2.5 scores with an AUC of 0.62. FRT differentiated recurrent fallers at a threshold of 18.15 cm with an AUC of 0.66.Number of medications, depression scores, and decreased FRT distance at baseline were associated with increased number of falls. Increased medications might indicate multiple comorbidities or polypharmacy effect; increased depression scores may indicate psychological status; and decreased functional reach distance could indicate dynamic balance impairments.II.Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

Educational level ranged as follows: 6.8% (n = 307) were at level 1 (≤ 6th grade), 34.6% (n = 1554) at level 2 (6-9th grade), 30.4% (n = 1364) at level 3 (10-12th grade) and 28.2% (n = 1265) at level 4 (≥ university degree). At 6 weeks post-partum re-evaluation, 10.9% (n = 491) had persistent glucose metabolism disorders. Educational levels 1 and 2 had a higher probability of persistent post-partum glucose metabolism disorders when compared to level 4 (OR = 2.37 [1.69;3.32], p < 0.001 and OR = 1.39 [1.09;1.76], p = 0.008, for level 1 and 2, respectively), an association that persisted in multivariable logistic regression adjusting for confounders (level 1 OR = 2.25 [1.53;3.33], p < 0.001; level 2 OR = 1.43 [1.09;1.89], p = 0.01).Persistent post-partum glucose metabolism disorders are frequent in women with GDM and associated with lower maternal educational level. Interventions aimed at this risk group may contribute towards a decrease in prevalence of post-partum glucose metabolism disorders.

We used data from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Mental Health, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of Canadians. This study included all participants aged 20years or older who reported being employed the past 12months (N=14,581). Child physical abuse, sexual abuse, and exposure to intimate partner violence were assessed in relation to several work stress-related indicators. Multiple linear and Poisson regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, household income, marital status, occupation group, and any lifetime mental disorder. Child abuse was significantly associated with greater odds of high work stress (IRR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.16-1.43) in adulthood. More specifically, child abuse was associated with greater odds of job dissatisfaction (IRR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.31-2.18), job insecurity (IRR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.27-1.91), and self-perceived low support (IRR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.22-1.46). It was also associated with high levels of psychological demand (b=0.348; 95% CI: 0.229-0.467) and job strain (b=0.031; 95% CI: 0.019-0.043). Examination of the Karasek's Demand-Control Model using multinomial logistic regression analyses indicated that child abuse was significantly associated with high strain (RRR:1.39; 95% CI: 1.14-1.72) and active (RRR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.28-1.90) jobs.
