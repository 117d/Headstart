Headstart
=========

Head Start presents you with the main areas in the field, and lets you zoom into
the most important publications within each area. It is intended to give
researchers that are new to a field a head start on their literature review
(hence the name).

To get the application running locally you can use the included ruby/server.rb.

    $ ruby server

should start a server at http://localhost:8000/.
