9303,Eliciting Requirements for Learning Design Tools A Semio-Participatory Approach,"The need to properly design educational intervention, representing ex-plicitly what students and teachers are planned to do, has been acknowledged in literature. Thus, Learning Design (LD) tools, if made accessible and usable by teachers, can bring significant benefits potentially improving results of educa-tional practices. Although effort has been made in developing systems to support the learning design process, literature has shown they have not yet reached a suf-ficient spread among teachers. This paper investigated the subject by conducting semio-participatory practices with a group of teachers at a distance, to understand the meaning they make to issues regarding learning design practices and repre-sentations, aiming at eliciting user requirements for a prospective LD tool.",EC-TEL,Full Paper,NA,0,Alessandro Arpetti;M.

9304,Technology use in lectures to enhance students? attention,"Mobile devices, such as laptops, smartphones and tablets, are ubiquitous in lectures. Students report to use their mobile devices for lecture-related activities (e.g. taking notes). Observational data shows, that students use mobile device mainly for lecture-unrelated activities, like Facebook or playing games. So currently, mobile devices seem to distract learners from the lecture and ultimately hinder student-teacher interaction. In this study, we investigated how students (n = 75) use their mobile devices (N = 80) in a traditional lecture setting when supported with the technological support system ?Backstage? or not. Backstage entails functions for quizzing students (Audience-Response-System) and a backchannel allowing students to interact with each other, commenting on slides, asking questions, and providing feedback to lecturers. The results show that this technology increases students? focus on lecture-related activities.",EC-TEL,Full Paper,NA,0,Vera Gehlen-Baum;Armin Weinberger;Alexander Pohl;Francois Bry;,-2.288456076,-0.118059108,2,mobile-device,Mobile device
9305,Digital Didactical Designs of Learning Expeditions,"Current studies on media tablets illustrated that mobile technology may improve learning when truly integrated into learning settings. The question remains what truly integrated means, how it might be operationalized. In a study of Scandinavian classrooms, the question was how teachers adopt and integrate media tablets in their teaching practices in order to provide learning opportunities for their students. Seven K-9 schools implemented media tablets for around 2,000 students aged 6-16 and ca. 170 teachers in a 1:1 programme launched in 2012 (one tablet per student). Mixed methods, interviews, classroom observations and online surveys have been applied. The findings illustrate new forms of teaching practices. Studying technology integration from the angle of a socio-technical-pedagogical practice, it reveals the interrelationship of teaching processes and quality of learning. This study shows five forms of Digital Didactical Design in practice, which affect tablet-mediated learning expeditions ? most of the designs boost learning, others restrict learning.

9306,"Technology Enhancing Learning: Past, Present and Future.","Every year the European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning (ECTEL) gathers state-of-the-art research in the TEL field. Eight years have passed since the first edition of this conference, resulting in over 500 research papers published and more than 1000 researchers involved. However, bringing together two di erent fields of study (Technology and Learning), does not necessarily imply interdisciplinary research. To inspect ECTEL?s interdisciplinarity and related facts, we dedicate this paper to study the evolution of the conference over time. In this paper, we provide a thorough analysis of the evolution of papers, authors and topics explored over the years. Our analysis provides an understanding of the origin of the conference and the direction that future research in TEL is moving towards. In addition to this, we built interactive online interfaces to enable researches to explore all the information pertaining to past ECTEL research. These interfaces enable users to easily browse through ECTEL papers, authors, knowledge and connections, possibly leveraging the discovery of related work and future collaborations.",EC-TEL,Full Paper,NA,0,Ricardo Kawase;Patrick Siehndel;Ujwal Gadiraju;,-1.418685189,-1.264702974,3,field-trip,Field trip
9307,Which Recommender System Can Best Fit Social Learning Platforms?,"This study aims to develop a recommender system for social learning platforms that combine traditional learning management systems with commercial social networks like Facebook. We therefore take into account social interactions of users to make recommendations on learning resources. We propose to make use of graph-walking methods for improving performance of the well-known baseline algorithms. We evaluate the proposed graph-based approach in terms of their F1 score, which is an effective combination of precision and recall as two fundamental metrics used in recommender systems area. The results show that the graph-based approach can help to improve performance of the baseline recommenders; particularly for rather sparse educational datasets used in this study.",EC-TEL,Full Paper,NA,0,Soude Fazeli;Babak Loni;Hendrik Drachsler;Peter Sloep;,2.376803776,-0.726716368,4,software-engineering,Software engineering

This approach solely relies on the usage of the learning resources and does not consider their content or the relations between the users and the resources. In order to cluster the resources, we calculate higher-order cooccurrences, a technique taken from corpus-driven lexicology where it is used to cluster words based on their usage in language. We  first outline how we adapt the approach to then present an extensive evaluation that shows the e ects of the clustering.

9309,Feature Analysis for Affect Recognition Supporting Task Sequencing in Adaptive Intelligent Tutoring Systems,"Originally, the task sequencing in adaptive intelligent tutoring systems needs information gained from expert and domain knowledge as well as information about former performances. In a former work a new  ecient task sequencer based on a performance prediction system was presented, which only needs former performance information but not the expensive expert and domain knowledge. This task sequencer uses the output of the performance prediction to sequence the tasks according to the theory of Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development. In this paper we aim to support this sequencer by a further automatically to gain information source, namely speech input from the students interacting with the tutoring system. The proposed approach extracts features from students speech data and applies to that features an automatic affect recognition method. The output of the a ect recognition method indicates, if the last task was too easy, too hard or appropriate for the student. Hence, as according to Vygotsky's theory the next task should not be too easy or too hard for the student to neither bore nor frustrate him, obviously the output of our proposed a ect recognition is suitable to be used as an input for supporting a sequencer based on the theory of Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development. Hence, in this paper we (1) propose a new approach for supporting task sequencing by a ect recognition, (2) present an analysis of appropriate features for a ect recognition extracted from students speech input and (3) show the suitability of the proposed features for a ect recognition for supporting task sequencing in adaptive intelligent tutoring systems.",EC-TEL,Full Paper,NA,0,Ruth Janning;Carlotta Schatten;Lars Schmidt-Thieme;,-2.420350097,0.252296089,2,mobile-device,Mobile device
9310,Abstraction of Learning Management Systems Instructional Design Semantics: a Meta-Modeling approach applied to the Moodle case-study,"Nowadays Learning Management Systems (LMS) are not restricted to distant uses. Nevertheless, the pedagogical expressiveness of designed courses is strongly dependent on the teacher's knowledge and expertise about the targeted platform. The funded GraphiT project aims to help teachers in focusing on the speci cation of pedagogically sound and technically executable learning designs. To this end, we propose to support teachers by providing an LMS-speci c Visual Instructional Design Language (VIDL). This paper proposes a speci c LMS- centered approach for raising the pedagogical expressiveness of its implicit learning design semantics. We discussed, in accordance to the activity theory, how the LMS low-level parameterizations could be abstracted in order to build higher- level building blocks.

9311,A Recommender System for Students Based on Social Knowledge and Assessment Data of Competences A Recommender System for Students Based on Social Knowledge and Assessment Data of Competences,"TEL Recommender systems have been used to improve experiences of students or teachers. Many such systems use information about students, such as interests, preferences, and demographic data. They also use resource metadata and ratings. The authors of this paper think that recommender systems are also valuable when implemented in online or blended courses using competence?based assessment since these systems can take advantage of social knowledge about competence development, and students? performance. By using collaborative filtering and knowledge?based techniques, it is possible to obtain recommendations from social knowledge and adapt the former to each student?s performance. In this paper, the authors propose a system to recommend activities and resources that help students in achieving competence levels throughout an online or blended course. This recommender system takes into consideration experiences previously stored and ranked by former students. In order to offer successful learning advice, this recommender system analyzes the student?s current competence levels against similar former students? performances. Functional test results indicate that the proposed technical approach is accurate. Moreover, these results seem to reflect that social knowledge and students' qualifications are sources of valuable recommendations for online and blended courses.",EC-TEL,Full Paper,NA,0,Oscar Chavarriaga;Beatriz Florian-Gaviria;Oswaldo Solarte;,1.262189386,-1.036042934,6,recommender-system,Recommender system
9312,Social network sites as a moderating factor in e-learning platform adoption. An extension,"The use of Social Network Sites (SNS), and the improvements gained from new technologies through e-learning platforms are two of the main topics that are currently discussed in the area of higher education. Acquiring a better understanding of e-Learning platform adoption requires the addition of new antecedents to prevailing models and an analysis of their interrelations with other information and communication technologies. Web 2.0 and SNS are of particular significance in this connection. This paper attempts to determine the validity of the antecedents posited by Chan et al. (2010) in the field of e-Learning and the moderating role that SNS use may play in platform adoption. The influence of awareness, self-efficacy, convenience and assistance as antecedents of the components of the adoption model is determined; it is further found that SNS use has a moderating effect on the relationship between the intention to use the platform and its posited antecedents.",EC-TEL,Full Paper,NA,0,Cayetano Medina;Ramon Rufin;,-1.470886834,-0.527784953,3,field-trip,Field trip

It goes on to identify benefits and challenges of teaching and learning at scale. A grounded approach was used to analyse data from 18 MOOCs run on the UK-based FutureLearn platform. This identified benefits and challenges for learners, for educators and for society as a whole.

Little work has been reported to foster awareness and decision competencies in complex decision situations involving incomplete information and multiple stakeholders. We address this issue exploring the technical requirements and possibilities to design games for such situations in three case studies: a hostage taking situation, a multi-stakeholder logistics case, and a health-care related emergency case. To implement the games, we use a multi-user enabled mobile game development platform (ARLearn). We describe the underlying real world situations and educational challenges and analyse how these are reflected in the ARLearn games realized. Based on these cases we propose a way to increase the immersiveness of mobile learning games.",EC-TEL,Full Paper,NA,0,Roland Klemke;Stefaan Ternier;Marco Kalz;Birgit Schmitz;Marcus Specht;,-1.991029393,-1.144194556,3,field-trip,Field trip

The study applies the Group Concept Method (GCM) to empirically depict criteria and their indicators for evaluating software applications in TEL. A statistical analysis including multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering on the GCM data identified the following six evaluation criteria: 1.Educational Innovation, 2.Usability, 3.Data, 4.Performance, 5.Privacy, and 6.Audience. Each of them was operationalized through a set of indicators. The resulting Evaluation Framework (EF) incorporating these criteria was applied to the first data competition of the LinkedUp project. The EF was consequently improved using the results from reviewers? interviews, which were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. The outcome of these efforts is a comprehensive EF that can be used for TEL data competitions and for the evaluation of TEL tools in general.

9316,"Learning Resource Recommendation: An Orchestration of Content-Based Filtering, Word Semantic Similarity and Page Ranking","Technologies supporting online education have been abundantly developed recent years. Many repositories of digital learning resources have been set up and many recommendation approaches have been proposed to facilitate the consummation of learning resources. In this paper, we present an approach that combines three recommendation technologies: content-based  ltering, word semantic similarity and page ranking to make resource recommendations. Content-based  ltering is applied to  lter syntactically learning resources that are similar to user profile. Word semantic similarity is applied to consolidate the content-based  ltering with word semantic meanings. Page ranking is applied to identify the importance of each resource according to its relations to others. Finally, a hybrid approach that orchestrates these techniques has been proposed. We performed several experiments on a public learning resource dataset. Results on similarity values, coverage of recommendations and computation time show that our approach is feasible.",EC-TEL,Full Paper,NA,0,Nguyen Ngoc Chan;Azim Roussanaly;Anne Boyer;,2.061961174,-0.812604794,4,software-engineering,Software engineering
9317,dmTEA: Mobile learning to aid in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders,"Mobile Learning is a teaching-learning methodology which has been developed successfully both inside and outside the classroom. Thanks to the several possibilities of mobile devices, it has been possible to use them with students with special educational needs thus giving rise to software applications focussed on competence acquisition on the students? part and offering such a high level of interaction that it could not be possible by using a PC. Advances in the development of mobile devices have made it feasible to go a step forward and help the teacher with the modelling and evaluation of this type of students. dmTEA is a mobile technology which allows both behaviour evaluation and modelling of students on the autism spectrum. It implements 12 activities ? du-ly verified by experts ? which are adapted to interaction with the mobile device within a specific context, the aim of which is to deal with student?s disorders by observing learning processes and modelling his or her behaviour during task performance. dmTEA implementation in two studies, i.e. a student with severe autism and another student with moderate autism, has helped the teacher at the time of evaluating by offering him or her the necessary information to carry out any possible intervention.",EC-TEL,Full Paper,NA,0,David Cabielles-Hernandez;Juan Ramon Perez-Perez;MPuerto Paule-Ruiz;Victor M.

9318,The Group Formation Problem: An Algorithmic Approach to Learning Group Formation,"Fostering knowledge exchange among peers is important for learners' motivation, achievement of learning goals as well as improvement of problem solving competency. Still, the positive e ects of such an exchange depend strongly on the suitability of the selected peers in a group. A comparison of existing algorithmic solutions applicable for E-learning and CSCL scenarios reveals limited support for requirements derived from related work in pedagogical psychology. Therefore, the GroupAL algorithm is proposed. It supports the use of criteria that are either expected to be matched homogeneous or heterogeneous among participants while aiming for equally good group formation for all groups. A normed metric allows for comparison of di erent group formations and is robust against variations. Finally, the evaluation reveals the advantages and widespread applicability of GroupAL.

9320,Do Optional Activities Matter in Virtual Learning Environments?,"Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) provide studentts with activities to improve their learning (e.g., reading texts, watching videos or solving exercises). But VLEs usually also provide optional activities (e.g., changing an avatar profile or setting goals). Some of these have a connection with the learning process, but are not directly devoted to learning concepts (e.g., setting goals). Few works have dealt with the use of optional activities and the relationships between these activities and other metrics in VLEs. This paper analyzes the use of optional activities at different levels in a specific case study with 291 students from three courses (physics, chemistry and mathematics) using the Khan Academy platform. The level of use of the different types of optional activities is analyzed and compared to that of learning activities.

9321,Mobile Inquiry-Based Learning with Sensor-Data in the School: Effects on Student Motivation,"The paper discusses the design, implementation and evaluation of a pilot project that integrated inquiry-based learning with mobile game design and introduced mobile devices and sensors into classroom learning. A 5-week classroom inquiry learning project on energy consumption was designed and implemented as a mobile serious game. While engaging in the game and training inquiry skills, students were introduced to basic concepts in the energy domain and to everyday practices of energy consumption in their direct environment. The design was based on a model of inquiry-based science learning with social and open mobile tools developed in the European research project weSPOT. The pilot indicated that using an ubiquitous tool does not necessarily help sustain student motivation. There are indications of gender differences in motivation related to use of mobile devices for learning. These differences should be taken into account in the design of activities. Implementation of the inquiry-based learning model in conjunction with a mobile game scenario into the school practice confirmed the importance of good design with sufficient testing and teacher ownership.",EC-TEL,Full Paper,NA,0,Olga Firssova;Marco Kalz;Dirk Borner;Fleur Prinsen;Ellen Rusman;Stefaan Ternier;Marcus Specht;,-2.868458644,-0.939094478,1,inquiry-based-learning,Inquiry-based learning

We describe a unique ecologically valid Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) study in a classroom equipped with computers, two of which were set up to allow human facilitators (wizards) to listen to students thinking-aloud while having access to their interaction with the environment. The wizards provided support using a script and following an iterative methodology that limited on purpose their communication capacity in order to simulate the actual system. Our results indicate that the feedback received from the wizards did serve its function i.e. it helped modify students' behaviour in that they did think-aloud signi cantly more than in past interactions and rephrased their language to employ mathematical terminology. Additional results from student perception questionnaires show that overall students  nd the system suggestions helpful, not repetitive and understandable. Most also enjoy thinking aloud to the computer but, as expected, some  nd the feedback cognitively overloading, indicating that more work is needed on how to design the interaction tipping the balance towards facilitating post-task reection.",EC-TEL,Full Paper,NA,0,Manolis Mavrikis;Beate Grawemeyer;Alice Hansen;Sergio Gutierrez-Santos;,-2.749564576,1.356631508,8,design-thinking,Design thinking

Typically, e-learning platforms do not provide the means to retrieve designed UoLs in a standardized format to be reused in a di erent platform, but they have in common that the students and teachers interaction with the system is logged to  les. Taking this into account, we propose to use these logs and apply a three steps re-engineering approach to translate these UoLs into an accepted educational modelling language, speci cally IMS LD. In the  rst step, the sequence of activities and their functional dependencies are learned by a process mining algorithm. In the second step, another algorithm analyses the variables and their value change in order to learn the adaptation rules that may have been de ned in the UoL. And  nally, in the last step the inferred process structure and rules are matched with the typical structure of activities, acts, and plays de ned by IMS LD.",EC-TEL,Full Paper,NA,0,Juan C.

By creating and validating this tool, we aim to establish a learning progression, inform science teaching, and tailor instruction to individual differences. Our findings suggest that students demonstrate differential ability in identifying SoK and thus imply the need for instruction to accommodate individual student perspectives on SoK. We expect that highlighting student ability in identifying SoK as a distinct skill will enable differentiated, adaptive instruction. We further expect this instrument to make explicit a component of what it means to think like a scientist, and in doing so facilitate conversations among teachers and students about the practice of science.",EC-TEL,Full Paper,NA,0,Ilya Goldin;Maggie Renken;April Galyardt;Ellen Litkowski;,-2.631969872,-0.146375287,2,mobile-device,Mobile device

Student motivation profile (high vs. low perceived competence and intrinsic motivation) has been used to assign them to either conceptual or procedural feedback condition. The data analysis shows that, for low motivated students, the benefits of adapting feedback to motivational profiles are visible in both, performance during treatment and knowledge gain from pre- to post-test.

Tackling this challenge, this paper provides a blueprint for software engineering process and infrastructure, which was distilled from successful practices in recent TEL projects. We present a composition of freely available instruments that support open, distributed software engineering practices using continuous integration processes. The blueprint considers the full development cycle including requirements engineering, software architecture, issue tracking, build management and social aspects of developer community building in TEL projects.

We then asked, ``What can we infer about the cognitive state of the student if they gave an incorrect response?'' Through data mining techniques, we found we were able to ascribe a particular type of mechanical error or misconception to 60-75\% of the incorrect responses learners made on the subset of problems we analyzed.

Due to the usage of standard technologies (AtomPub, HTTP and JSON), OData has gained widespread attention within the industry lately. Companies such as Microsoft and eBay provide OData interfaces for their applications and services. SAP provides OData support not only for its ERP-system but for the whole Business Suite. In order to simplify the retrieval of data from ERP-systems and to make them available for the integration with the Semantic Web, we present an approach to realize SPARQL endpoints on top of OData interfaces. The work presented in this paper mainly consists of two parts. In the first part, we define an extension of the Conceptual Schema Definition Language (CSDL) to semantically annotate OData services. In the second part, we adapt the evaluation semantics of SPARQL algebra expressions with regard to graph templates which are defined by the semantically annotated CSDL documents. Based on the adapted evaluation, we can determine the relevant OData services that need to be queried to answer a given SPARQL query.

In this paper, we introduce the EMSE Research Knowledge Base Building (RKB) process, which guides knowledge engineers in developing and using a knowledge base (KB) for the SKE process based on contributions from heterogeneous data sources. We evaluate the RKB process in the context of three research topics from the EM-SE domain: software inspection experiments, theory construct identification, and threats to validity. Major results are that the RKB process is effective in guiding the knowledge engineer to build a KB that allows answering the EMSE-specific queries.

9356,Visual Access to Agent-based Simulation Models to Support Political Decision Making,"Decision making in the field of policy making is a complex task. On the one hand conflicting objectives influence the availability of alternative solutions for a given problem. On the other hand economic, social, and environmental impacts of the chosen solution have to be considered. In the political context, these solutions are called policy options. To tackle societal problems a thorough analysis of policy options needs to be executed before a policy can be put into practice. Computational simulation is a method considered for measuring the impacts of policy options. However, due to their complexity, the underlying models and their output may be difficult to access by decision makers. In this work, we present a visual-interactive interface for an agent-based simulation model that enables decision makers to evaluate the impacts of alternative policy options in the field of regional energy planning. The decision maker can specify different subsidy strategies for supporting public photovoltaic installations as input and evaluate their impact on the actual adoption via the simulation output.

Therefore, high potential to contribute to the company`s well-fare can be assumed for diverse application scenarios and various industries, even gaining momentum by including modern forms of interactivity. Possible application scenarios reach from collaboratively solving a field service engineer?s problem at hand through on-site video authoring to video-based instructions as innovative application in the field of e-health.

Classic 18th or 19th century DataViz solutions may then appear as respectable, but deprecated ? far too simple to match today?s challenges. In this paper we try to show that the very simplicity of these solutions can still be of help in problem-solving situations. We first revisit some great classics in order to uncover patterns and exceptions inside a data set consisting of incomplete historical evidence on groups of stalls that used to be located on the market square in Cracow. We show that, once reinterpreted and re-implemented, classic visualisations like tableaux pol√©om√©triques of Charles De Fourcroy or Munehisa Homma?s candlestick chart can be successfully reused to read other types of data than these for which they were designed. We then introduce an online, free to use implementation of these classics that we expect to weigh through a sort-of crowdsourcing approach to which extent they can act as relevant and generic visual formalisms.

But when scientific backgrounds, skills, references, specialized languages and specialized knowledge are too far apart people involved in an interdisciplinary process face a real communication challenge. Communication is here not the best word ? it minors the challenge. What actors face is the challenge to reach a common understanding of facts and of pictures of facts, in other words to build a common, unambiguous, knowledge space. Not making this effort often results in misunderstandings, and accordingly in delays and inefficiency. At the end of the day, results may turn out as a nice patchwork rather than as new knowledge. In this contribution we show that it can be worth having actors get aware of distances between them, of overlaps and non-overlaps in terms of methods, specialised language, references and concepts. We present a series of short experiments that are an attempt to ?measure? and then visualize the above mentioned distances, and can act as eye openers for a community.",i-KNOW,Knowledge Visualization,NA,0,Jean-Yves Blaise;Iwona Dudek;,-2.034814405,0.609157212,10,developing-country,Developing country
9362,Measuring Context Relevance for Adaptive Semantics Visualizations,"Semantics visualizations enable the acquisition of information to amplify the acquisition of knowledge. The dramatic increase of semantics in form of Linked Data and Linked Open Data yield search databases that allow to visualize the entire context of search results. The visualization of this semantic context enables one to gather more information at once, but the complex structures may as well confuse and frustrate users. To overcome the problems, adaptive visualizations already provide some useful methods to adapt the visualization on users? demands and skills. Although these methods are very promising, these systems do not investigate the relevance of semantic neighboring entities that commonly build most information value. We introduce two new measurements for the relevance of neighboring entities: The Inverse Instance Frequency allows weighting the relevance of semantic concepts based on the number of their instances. The Direct Relation Frequency inverse Relations Frequency measures the relevance of neighboring instances by the type of semantic relations. Both measurements provide a weighting of neighboring entities of a selected semantic instance, and enable an adaptation of retinal variables for the visualized graph. The algorithms can easily be integrated into adaptive visualizations and enhance them with the relevance measurement of neighboring semantic entities. We give a detailed description of the algorithms to enable a replication for the adaptive and semantics visualization community. With our method, one can now easily derive the relevance of neighboring semantic entities of selected instances, and thus gain more information at once, without confusing and frustrating users.",i-KNOW,Knowledge Visualization,NA,0,Kawa Nazemi;Arjan Kuijper;Marco Hutter;Jorn Kohlhammer;Dieter W.

A ramp-up team needs to find a capable production process for a new production site to produce the product in sufficient quality and volume efficiently and with reasonable investment costs. Capable production processes have to be qualified first regarding the specification criteria of the created product.

In this paper, we present a method to infer location information from user-generated geographic information retrieved from Wikimapia and Foursquare. Using a sample of 139 Indonesian factories supplying large international corporations, we compared results from our approach with locations retrieved from four widely-used geocoding services. We found that best results could be achieved using data from Foursquare, where we retrieved a location within 1km for 73% of the factories. Given that coordinates are only an input for decision making, we linked retrieved locations exemplary to semantic data to determine the risk exposure due to volcanic eruptions for each factory.

To achieve a real CEE, interoperability between systems is needed to enable interaction with external tools, thus providing an enhanced learning experience. This paper will explore a semantic interoperability solution for cloud-based tools in an educational setting. It will focus on the use case of mind maps for learning activities and present a proposed generic ontology for interoperability of mind map tools. Based on the ontology, its application with the recently presented W3C approaches to JSON-LD and Hydra is introduced. It will describe a Web API for integration and interoperability. The focus of this paper is a description of the common characteristics of mind map tools, such as their resources, operations, and properties, which will create a definition of the generic vocabulary when using Hydra.

Na ? ?ve Bayes, with its variations and Support Vector Machine are a commonly used baseline in the sentiment analysis task. However, their reported performance varies among researchers and has led to a divergence as to which is the best baseline classifier that can be used in the sentiment analysis task.

We explore three examples: (i) social media based competence management in career guidance, (ii) ontology-centered reflection in multiprofessional environments in palliative care, and (iii) aligning individual mindlines in pratice networks of General Practitioners. Based on these, we extract four levels of designing for knowledge maturing and associated technical implementations. This shows that future technology support should especially target facilitation of self-organized, but tool-mediated knowledge development processes, where, e.g., workplace learning analytics can play a prominent role.",i-KNOW,Social Computing,NA,0,Andreas Schmidt;Christine Kunzmann;,1.793626559,-1.224507695,4,software-engineering,Software engineering
9368,Analysis of word co-occurrence in human literature for supporting semantic correspondence discovery,"Semantic similarity measurement aims to determine the likeness between two text expressions that use different lexicographies for representing the same real object or idea. In this work, we describe the way to exploit broad cultural trends for identifying semantic similarity. This is possible through the quantitative analysis of a vast digital book collection representing the digested history of humanity. Our research work has revealed that appropriately analyzing the co-occurrence of words in some periods of human literature can help us to determine the semantic similarity between these words by means of computers with a high degree of accuracy.",i-KNOW,Knowledge & Data Analytics,NA,0,Jorge Martinez-Gil;Mario Pichler;,3.111962734,-0.389986635,7,big-data,Big data
9369,TimeCleanser: A Visual Analytics Approach for Data Cleansing of Time-Oriented Data,"Poor data quality leads to unreliable results of any kind of data processing and has profound economic impact. Although there are tools to help users with the task of data cleansing, support for dealing with the specifics of time-oriented data is rather poor. However, the time dimension has very specific characteristics which introduce quality problems, that are different from other kinds of data. We present TimeCleanser, an interactive Visual Analytics system to support the task of data cleansing of time-oriented data. In order to help the user to deal with these special characteristics and quality problems, TimeCleanser combines semi-automatic quality checks, visualizations, and directly editable data tables. The evaluation of the TimeCleanser system within a focus group (two target users, one developer, and two Human Computer Interaction experts) shows that (a) our proposed method is suited to detect hidden quality problems of time-oriented data and (b) that it facilitates the complex task of data cleansing.",i-KNOW,Knowledge Visualization,NA,0,Theresia Gschwandtner;Wolfgang Aigner;Silvia Miksch;Simone Kriglstein;Margit Pohl;Nik Suchy;Johannes Gaertner;,3.622644776,-0.252787172,7,big-data,Big data
9370,Does one size really fit all? - Evaluating classifiers in Bag-of-Visual-Words classification,"Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) features that quantize and count local gradient distributions in images similar to counting words in texts have proven to be powerful image representations. In combination with supervised machine learning approaches, models for various visual concepts can be learned. While kernel-based Support Vector Machines have emerged as a de facto standard an extensive comparison of different supervised machine learning approaches has not been performed so far. In this paper we compare and discuss the performance of eight different classification models to be applied in BoVW approaches for image classification: Na ? ?ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, k-nearest neighbors, Random Forests, AdaBoost and linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) as well as generalized Gaussian kernel SVMs. Our results show that despite kernel-based SVMs performing best on the official Caltech-101 dataset, ensemble methods fall only shortly behind. In addition we present an approach for intuitive heat map-like visualization of the obtained models that help to better understand the reasons of a specific classification result.",i-KNOW,Knowledge & Data Analytics,NA,0,Christian Hentschel;Harald Sack;,2.21041172,1.906844399,11,sentiment-analysis,Sentiment analysis
9371,Is Enterprise Search Useful At All? Lessons Learned From Studying User Behavior,"Enterprise search is a growing industry: A recent report from the EU states the total revenue of EU-headquartered search vendors between 100 and 200 million Euros. However, enterprise search seems to be widely ignored by the academic information systems (IS) community. Little is known about user-adoption aspects of enterprise search, as almost no academic case studies and very few user evaluations are reported, leaving the topic more or less in hand of practitioners. A preliminary literature review reveals enterprise search user-aspects and especially perceived overall helpfulness as under-investigated subjects. The following paper provides insights into a qualitative study involving ten engineers from automotive and rail industry. While observing them using a piloted enterprise search engine, the authors report qualitative findings on how engineers apply enterprise search on project-relevant documents. With this paper, the authors want to contribute to the user-centered investigation of enterprise search and intranet search behavior and highlight the importance of scientific user studies in enterprise search.",i-KNOW,Social & Ubiquitous Computing,NA,0,Alexander Stocker;Markus Zoier;Selver Softic;Heimo Bischofter;Roman Kern;,2.376037145,0.114747586,9,enterprise-search,Enterprise search

The described system collects user and usage data from multiple devices (PC and mobile). Such data is used to create open learner models for reflection on and improvement of time management. Additionally, such data is the basis for adaptation of notification mechanisms. We propose concepts for secure local storage of collected data, network communication and user authentication, and secure data storage and processing on the server side. We only touch partially on security concepts for client services and applications.

For this task, we employ the history of timestamped mention interactions between both users as time series features. We also tackle the problem of efficiently balancing a large dataset with a skewed class distribution, which arises naturally in our context. The proposed impurity-based supervised sampling (ISS) approach balances the data in one pass by removing trivial training data of the overrepresented class. Our approach is evaluated using the well known Twitter dump of 2009 [25]. We show, that ISS outperforms downsampling with regard to the resulting predictor performance.",i-KNOW,Social Computing,NA,0,Bjorn Elmar Macek;Martin Atzmueller;Gerd Stumme;,2.729784507,0.651502257,9,enterprise-search,Enterprise search

9376,Towards Modelling Visual Ambiguity for Visual Object Detection,"The widespread adoption of Web 2.0 applications has resulted in the creation of huge amounts of user-generated multimedia content, a fact that motivated the investigation of employing this content for training. However, the nature of these annotations (i.e. global level) and the noise existing in the associated information, as well as the ambiguity that characterizes these examples disqualifies them from being directly appropriate learning samples. Nevertheless, the tremendous volume of data that is currently hosted in social networks gives us the luxury to disregard a substantial number of candidate learning examples, provided we can devise a gauging mechanism that could filter out any ambiguous or noisy samples. Our objective in this work is to define a measure for visual ambiguity, which is caused by the visual similarity of semantically dissimilar concepts, in order to help in the process of selecting positive training regions from user tagged images. This is done by limiting the search space of the potential images to the ones yielding a higher probability to contain the desired regions, while at the same time not including visually ambiguous objects that could confuse the selection algorithm. Experimental results show that the employment of visual ambiguity allows for better separation between the targeted true positive and the undesired negative regions.",i-KNOW,Knowledge & Data Analytics,NA,0,Elisavet Chatzilari;Spiros Nikolopoulos;Yiannis Kompatsiaris;Josef Kittler;,2.915550394,0.222892096,9,enterprise-search,Enterprise search

9380,Open Learning & Teaching,"Learning is often viewed as something individuals do as they acquire information and skills. It is usually associated with some form of instruction. I will present a different perspective on learning, one that starts with the assumption that learning is an inherent dimension of everyday life and that it is fundamentally a social process. From this perspective, a living ‚Äúbody of knowledge‚Äù can be viewed as collection of communities of practice. Learning is not merely the acquisition of a curriculum, but a journey across this landscape of practice, which is transformative of the self. Achieving a high level of ‚Äúknowledgeability‚Äù is a matter of negotiating a productive identity with respect to the various practices that constitute this landscape. Education is then a guided tour of the various practices that constitute this landscape. Teaching is one of these practices, located like all others in a complex landscape, but with the additional twist that it has to prepare students for their own trajectory through landscapes of practice. This presentation will review the main tenets of this learning theory as well as more recent developments as they pertain to our understanding of learning in the 21st century.",i-KNOW,Keynote,NA,0,Etienne Wenger-Trayner;,-3.442953922,0.455090826,8,design-thinking,Design thinking

The idea: teams of students with different backgrounds collaborate in a creative environment to solve complex problems in all areas of life. Now, nine years later, the d.school is one of the most interesting think tanks in Silicon Valley, training about 700 students to become team based innovators. The Germany based sister institute ‚ÄúSchool of Design Thinking‚Äù started 2007 with an even more radical approach, inviting students from different universities to collaborate in a specially designed environment in Potsdam, near Berlin. 120 students from 75 different backgrounds from 65 different universities and 20 different nations are working in small multi disciplinary teams. They tackle real life problems and come up with groundbreaking solutions for companies and institutions like Daimler, DHL, Siemens, Deutsche Telekom and SAP. In 2008 they also started training professionals. Half of the ‚ÄúDAX30‚Äù companies are cooperating with the School of Design Thinking.
